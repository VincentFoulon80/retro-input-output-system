# The selector
The selector is an app that allows you to select from multiple apps to start up.

## Current features:
- Grid based selection menu
- Fully adjustable to your preference
- Limiting of string length to prevent exceeding the width of the box
- Allow apps to provide icons for their box
- Text and grid boxes will center horizontally
- Scroll indicator arrows
## To-do:
- Possibly make boxes auto-calculate height and word-wrap to fit all of the app name in

## Docs [WIP]:
- Syntax for defining an app is `{name="name",app=luafile,icon={"image",x,y}}`
