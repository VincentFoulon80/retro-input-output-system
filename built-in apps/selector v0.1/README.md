# The selector
The selector is an app that allows you to select from multiple apps to start up.

## Current features:
- Grid based selection menu
- Fully adjustable to your preference
- Limiting of string length to prevent exceeding the width of the box
## To-do:
- Allow apps to provide icons for their box
- Possibly make boxes auto-calculate height and word-wrap to fit all of the app name in
